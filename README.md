# Pymaceutical Visualizations
## Overview

This was a mock assignment for Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. All provided data can be found [here.](https://github.com/ohigithub/pymaceuticals_visualizations/tree/main/data)

To compare the treatments, I generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and created a top-level summary of the study results.
